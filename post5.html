<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barbora_Zahlavova_Strycova_San_Diego.jpg"></a>Playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport">sports</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn_tennis">lawn tennis</a> is a common way to maintain/improve physical fitness. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiorespiratory_fitness">Cardiorespiratory fitness</a> can be measured using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max">VO<sub>2</sub> max</a>, a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-r27-17">[17]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-pmid23025219-18">[18]</a></sup> Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increase stamina, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption. This form of exercise is an important part of all training regiments, whether for professional athletes or for the everyday person.</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogging">Jogging</a>&nbsp;– Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises.</li>

<li>Working on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_trainer">elliptical trainer</a>&nbsp;– This is a stationary&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_machine">exercise machine</a>&nbsp;used to perform&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking">walking</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running">running</a>&nbsp;without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking">Walking</a>&nbsp;– Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill">Treadmill</a>&nbsp;training – Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_up">warm up</a>&nbsp;first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming">Swimming</a>&nbsp;– Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat in water and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling">Cycling</a> – Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.</li>

<h3>Anaerobic exercise</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that does not require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy. It helps to promote strength,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance">endurance</a>, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity. Anaerobic exercises are thought to increase the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_rate">metabolic rate</a>, thereby allowing one to burn additional calories as the body recovers from exercise due to an increase in body temperature and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) after the exercise ended.</p>
