<h4>Overview about Fitness</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>&nbsp;and the treatise of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">human</a>&nbsp;adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness">physical attractiveness</a>&nbsp;that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise">aerobic</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_exercise">anaerobic</a>&nbsp;ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.</p>

<p>A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and on age-<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> or health-related needs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_health">bone health</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Many sources<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> also cite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health">mental</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_health">social</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_health">emotional health</a> as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle">triangle</a> made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness has been shown to have benefits in preventing ill health and assisting recovery from injury or illness. Along with the physical health <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_of_physical_activity">benefits of fitness</a>, it has also been shown to have a positive impact on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health">mental health</a> as well by assisting in treating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)">depression</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition">chronic health conditions</a> brought on by unhealthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)">lifestyle</a> or aging as well and has been listed frequently as one of the most popular and advantageous self-care therapies.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Working out can also help some people sleep better by building up sleeping pressure and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.</p>

<p>Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_organ">endocrine organ</a>. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myokine">myokines</a>, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.</p>
